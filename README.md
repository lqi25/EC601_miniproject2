# Unsupervised Learning
## Introduction
Unsupervised learning is one of three important categories of machine learning. Unsupervised learning is often used for data mining, and the data sets it uses are unlabeled. Unsupervised learning classifies data sets by learning the unlabeled data sets and revealing the laws and characteristics that exist in the data. Clustering is one of the main methods in unsupervised learning. It includes algorithms such as K-means and OPTICS, which can effectively distinguish data. Unsupervised learning has a wide range of applications in areas such as image processing and artificial intelligence.

## Summary of references
Unsupervised Learning of Object Keypoints for Perception and Control   
- In this paper, the author learns the original video through the unsupervised learning method, and uses the key bottleneck to transfer the image features between video frames, which can track the object more accurately in a longer time range. People can flexibly represent key points of the object for effective control and reinforcement learning.     

Unsupervised natural image patch learning
- In this paper, for unlabeled images, the authors used an unsupervised method of embedding natural image patches. The similarity of the two patches can be understood from the prevalence of spatial similarity in natural images.

## Pros & Cons
### Pros
- The data sets processed by unsupervised learning do not require tags, and the range of unsupervised learning applications is extensive.
- Unsupervised learning can analyze and extract similar features of a data set.
- Unsupervised learning has a variety of methods such as K-means, self-encoders, and principal component analysis.

### Cons
- Unsupervised learning has limitations and sometimes does not yield satisfactory results.
- The results of unsupervised learning are often inferior to supervised learning.

## Recommendations
Unsupervised learning is useful when dealing with unlabeled data sets. If you want to understand unsupervised learning, I think we must first understand the meaning and application scenarios of unsupervised learning, and then understand some of the algorithms that are often used. We need to understand the principles of these algorithms, the effects, and their advantages and disadvantages, and then implement these algorithms in code. When applied to a dataset, we first need to analyze the dataset and then process the dataset using the appropriate algorithm.
