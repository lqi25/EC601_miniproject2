# Unsupervised Learning
## Introduction
Unsupervised learning is one of three important categories of machine learning. Unsupervised learning is often used for data mining, and the data sets it uses are unlabeled. Unsupervised learning classifies data sets by learning the unlabeled data sets and revealing the laws and characteristics that exist in the data. Clustering is one of the main methods in unsupervised learning. It includes algorithms such as K-means and OPTICS, which can effectively distinguish data. Unsupervised learning has a wide range of applications in areas such as image processing and artificial intelligence.

  - In this paper, the author learns the original video through the unsupervised learning method, and uses the key bottleneck to transfer the image features between video frames, which can track the object more accurately in a longer time range. People can flexibly represent key points of the object for effective control and reinforcement learning.
